# Car-parking-timer
The project is focused on creating a software solution for a car parking  meter using the 8086 microprocessor and emu8086. 
This software allows drivers to input money, which determines their parking duration based on a predefined price list. It manages parking time, and when the time has expired, it activates an LED display, providing a user-friendly and efficient parking management system.
For our project, the amount entered and timer durations are:
₹5 – 5 seconds
₹10 – 30 seconds
₹20 – 60 seconds
For real-world applications, the timer duration will be more than what we have here, but for our ease, the timers are set to lower values.
